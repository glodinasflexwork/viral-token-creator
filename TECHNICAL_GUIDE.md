### Component Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns. Each component is designed to be reusable, testable, and maintainable.

#### Core Components Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/                    # Base UI components (Radix + Tailwind)
│   │   ├── button.jsx
│   │   ├── card.jsx
│   │   ├── input.jsx
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── WalletProvider.jsx     # Solana wallet context provider
│   └── WalletConnection.jsx   # Wallet connection interface
├── App.jsx                    # Main application component
├── main.jsx                   # React entry point
└── App.css                    # Global styles and Tailwind config
```

#### State Management Strategy

The application uses React's built-in state management with hooks, avoiding external state management libraries to keep the bundle size minimal and reduce complexity. The state is organized into logical groups:

**Token Configuration State:**
```javascript
const [tokenData, setTokenData] = useState({
  name: '',
  symbol: '',
  description: '',
  supply: '1000000000',
  decimals: '9',
  theme: 'custom',
  website: '',
  twitter: '',
  telegram: '',
  discord: '',
  viralFeatures: []
})
```

**Application Flow State:**
```javascript
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(0)
const [isCreating, setIsCreating] = useState(false)
const [createdToken, setCreatedToken] = useState(null)
const [network, setNetwork] = useState('devnet')
const [walletInfo, setWalletInfo] = useState(null)
```

### User Interface Design

The interface follows modern design principles with emphasis on user experience, accessibility, and visual hierarchy. The design system is built on top of Radix UI primitives, ensuring accessibility compliance and consistent behavior across different browsers and devices.

#### Design System Principles

**Color Palette:**
The application uses a carefully crafted color palette that works in both light and dark modes. The primary colors are purple and pink gradients that convey innovation and energy, while maintaining sufficient contrast for accessibility.

**Typography:**
The typography system uses system fonts for optimal performance and readability. Font sizes follow a modular scale that ensures visual hierarchy and readability across different screen sizes.

**Spacing and Layout:**
The layout system uses Tailwind's spacing scale based on rem units, ensuring consistent spacing throughout the application. The responsive design adapts seamlessly from mobile devices to large desktop screens.

#### Step-by-Step Wizard Implementation

The token creation process is implemented as a multi-step wizard that guides users through the configuration process. Each step is validated before allowing progression, ensuring data integrity and user guidance.

**Step Validation Logic:**
```javascript
const isStepValid = () => {
  switch (currentStep) {
    case 0: // Token Details
      return tokenData.name && tokenData.symbol && tokenData.description
    case 1: // Viral Features
      return tokenData.viralFeatures.length > 0
    case 2: // Social Links
      return true // Optional step
    case 3: // Deploy
      if (network === 'mainnet') {
        return walletInfo && walletInfo.connected
      }
      return true
    default:
      return false
  }
}
```

### Animation and Interactions

The application uses Framer Motion to create smooth, purposeful animations that enhance the user experience without being distracting. Animations are used strategically to provide feedback, guide attention, and create a sense of progression through the token creation process.

**Key Animation Patterns:**
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth slide animations between wizard steps
- **Loading States**: Spinning indicators and progress bars during token creation
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover effects, button states, and form feedback
- **Success Celebrations**: Celebratory animations upon successful token creation

### Responsive Design Implementation

The application is designed mobile-first with progressive enhancement for larger screens. The responsive design ensures optimal usability across all device types, from smartphones to large desktop monitors.

**Breakpoint Strategy:**
- **Mobile**: 320px - 768px (Primary focus)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (Optimized layouts)
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (Enhanced features and spacing)

The responsive implementation uses Tailwind's responsive prefixes to create adaptive layouts that maintain usability and visual appeal across all screen sizes.

## Backend API Design

### Flask Application Architecture

The backend is implemented as a RESTful API using Flask, chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and excellent Python ecosystem integration. The API follows REST principles with clear resource-based endpoints and appropriate HTTP methods.

#### API Structure

```python
api/
├── app.py              # Main Flask application
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
└── __pycache__/       # Python bytecode cache
```

The Flask application is designed to be stateless, making it perfect for serverless deployment on Vercel. All token creation logic is encapsulated in the `TokenCreator` class, which handles the interaction with Solana networks.

#### Core API Classes

**TokenCreator Class:**
The `TokenCreator` class serves as the main interface for blockchain operations. It abstracts the complexity of Solana interactions and provides a clean interface for the frontend.

```python
class TokenCreator:
    def __init__(self, network="devnet"):
        self.network = network
        self.rpc_url = DEVNET_RPC if network == "devnet" else MAINNET_RPC
    
    def create_wallet(self):
        """Generate a new Solana wallet keypair"""
        # Implementation details...
    
    def create_token(self, token_data, private_key=None):
        """Create a new SPL token on Solana"""
        # Implementation details...
    
    def get_token_info(self, mint_address):
        """Retrieve token information from the blockchain"""
        # Implementation details...
```

### API Endpoints Documentation

The API provides several endpoints for token creation, wallet management, and utility functions. Each endpoint is designed to be idempotent where appropriate and follows RESTful conventions.
